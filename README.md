# co2countdown
A mobile game, written with Godot 3.4.2:
Take measures to stop the global CO2 emissions before the countdown reaches 0.

The remaining CO2 budget allows 300'000 Megatonnes, as of 2022, according to the IPCC. If you let the counter decrease below zero, the global temperature will rise beyond 1,5 °C and the earth will face a climate catastrophe!
You can reduce CO2 emissions through upgrading policies in domains like Traffic, Energy, Agriculture, Buildings, Industry for each continent individually. Your actions affect the screws Substitution, Efficiency and Sufficiency.
Will you succeed in saving the earth?
